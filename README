INTRODUCTION

  I started designing a new project not-so-long-ago and wanted to store some
  design color schemes on my trac wiki. It might seem useless to create a plugin  for this, since I could just as well used html blocks for it, but it was good 
  practice on how to start Trac plugin development.

COLORSCHEME

  A quick way to add some ‘color schemes’ to your wiki pages.

    [[ColorScheme(#00ff00, #ff0000, #0000ff)]]

  or with comments:

    {{{#!ColorScheme
    #00ff00 green
    rgb(255\,0\,0) red
    "rgb(255, 255, 0)" Your title / description
    #00f
    }}}

COLORGRADIENT

  Basic:

    [[ColorGradient(#00ff00, #ff0000, #0000ff)]]

  same with a title:

    {{{#!ColorGradient title="Your title / description"
    #00ff00
    rgb(255\,0\,0)
    "rgb(255, 255, 0)"
    #00f
    }}}
